# Terraform-Plugin-With Github
 short summary of the process to create a Terraform plugin and integrate it with GitHub:

### 1. **Set Up the Project**:
   - **Install Go, Git, and Terraform** on your machine.
   - **Create a new directory** for your plugin: `mkdir terraform-provider-example`.
   - **Initialize a Go module**: `go mod init github.com/yourusername/terraform-provider-example`.

### 2. **Write the Plugin Code**:
   - Create key files:
     - `main.go`: Entry point for the plugin.
     - `provider.go`: Defines the provider and resources.
     - `resource_example.go`: Implements the resource logic.
   
   Use the **Terraform Plugin SDK** to write your plugin.

### 3. **Build the Plugin**:
   - Run: `go build -o terraform-provider-example` to create the plugin binary.

### 4. **Test the Plugin Locally**:
   - Move the binary to Terraform's plugins directory: `~/.terraform.d/plugins/...`.
   - Write a simple Terraform configuration file to test the plugin.
   - Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to verify the plugin works.

### 5. **Push the Code to GitHub**:
   - **Initialize Git** in your project: `git init`.
   - **Add your code**: `git add .` and commit: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.
   - **Create a GitHub repository** and link it: `git remote add origin <repo-url>`.
   - Push the code: `git push -u origin master`.

### 6. **Optional - Add CI with GitHub Actions**:
   - Use a `.github/workflows/go.yml` file to automate builds and tests using **GitHub Actions**.

### this operation is the creation and deployment of a custom Terraform provider from scratch, allowing you to extend Terraform’s functionality by managing resources that aren't supported by default.

### Custom Terraform Provider: You create a plugin that defines new resources and providers, enabling you to manage infrastructure or services specific to your needs.

### Using Go: The provider is written in the Go programming language, leveraging Terraform’s Plugin SDK, which makes the process modular and efficient.

### Integration with GitHub: The project is version-controlled using Git and published on GitHub, allowing for collaboration, continuous integration, and versioning. It also allows others to easily access and contribute to the provider.

### Testing and CI/CD: The use of GitHub Actions or other CI tools ensures that the provider is tested and built automatically, making it robust and reliable.

### In short, build, test, and share a custom Terraform provider that expands infrastructure automation capabilities while integrating best practices for software development with version control and CI/CD.
