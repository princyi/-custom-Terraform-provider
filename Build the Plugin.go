To build your plugin, run the following command in the root of your project:
bash
Copy code
go build -o terraform-provider-example
This will create an executable for your Terraform plugin.

4. Test the Plugin Locally
To test your plugin with Terraform, you need to move the built binary into your Terraform plugins directory:

Create the directory:
bash
Copy code
mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/github.com/yourusername/example/1.0.0/linux_amd64/
Move the binary into the directory:
bash
Copy code
mv terraform-provider-example ~/.terraform.d/plugins/github.com/yourusername/example/1.0.0/linux_amd64/
Now, create a simple Terraform configuration to test your plugin:

hcl
Copy code
provider "example" {}

resource "example_resource" "test" {
  name = "Hello, Terraform!"
}

output "example_output" {
  value = example_resource.test.name
}
Run the following commands to test it:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
terraform apply
If successful, Terraform should create the example_resource and display the output.

5. Push the Plugin Code to GitHub
Now, let's push the code to GitHub so that others can access it and contribute.

Step 1: Create a Repository on GitHub
Log in to GitHub.
Click on the + icon in the top-right corner and select New repository.
Name your repository (for example, terraform-provider-example).
Choose Public or Private, depending on your preference.
Click Create repository.
Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Local Project
Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/terraform-provider-example
Initialize Git:
bash
Copy code
git init
Add your files to Git:
bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit your changes:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit with Terraform provider code"
Step 3: Link to GitHub and Push Code
Copy the repository URL from GitHub.
Add the remote origin:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-provider-example.git
Push your code:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
Now, your Terraform plugin code is available on GitHub!

6. Optional: Add GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI)
You can use GitHub Actions to automate testing and building of your Terraform provider.

Create a .github/workflows/go.yml file:
yaml
Copy code
name: Go

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v2
      with:
        go-version: '^1.16'

    - name: Build Terraform provider
      run: go build -o terraform-provider-example

    - name: Run tests
      run: go test ./...
This workflow will automatically build and test your provider every time you push new changes to GitHub.
